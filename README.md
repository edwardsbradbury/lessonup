# lessonup
A Node/Express/MySQL REST API and a Vue user interface, for university 2nd year 'Software Project' module.

The application is named LessonUp and is intended for migrant parents in the UK - specifically those with poor English literacy - to seek help explaining their childrens' homework for them. The application is hosted at https://lessonup.herokuapp.com/#/.

This module of study spanned the duration of the entire academic year and was assessed through two pieces of coursework, which were completed as a team consisting of myself and four other people.

The first assignment was to research, plan and write a proposal for the software we intended to build. This assignment was worth 30% of the overall marks for the year (for this module of study) and my group scored 57%.

The second assignment was to actually develop the software we had proposed and to write a report about how we had approached the project and what we learned in the process. This assignment was worth 70% of the overall marks for the year. My group scored 86% for this assignment and 81% overall for the whole module of study.

Briefs for both assignents are in the repository at the top level, with titles beginning 'CW brief'. Our software proposal and final report are also in the repository at the top level, along with the XD prototypes, partial* version control logs and our lecturer's feedback for each assignment.

*Git version logs are incomplete due to our not having fully got to grips with using git until almost mid-way into the project.
